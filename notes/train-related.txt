train a model to say if 2 vectors are related, ie. same context
then I can shift the training set and get context groups.
assuming that all contexts are contiguous in time.

how does assemblyai, chatgpt deal with arbitrary length input?
does it pad to a fixed size ie. "context window" ?


train a model to say if one vector has a property "working on project A"
train a model to say if one vector has a property "working on project B"

combine 2 models to get a tuple, {projectA? , projectB?}
